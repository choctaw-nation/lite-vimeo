# \<lite-vimeo\>

> A web component that displays Vimeo embeds faster. Based on @slightlyoff's work (among others), this extends the component to allow for custom image placeholders and unlisted videos.

## Features

-   No dependencies; it's just vanilla JS & a web component.
-   It's fast üèéÔ∏è.
-   It's Shadow Dom encapsulated!
-   It's responsive 16:9
-   It's accessible via keyboard and will set ARIA via the `videotitle` attribute
-   It's locale ready; you can set the `videoplay` to have a properly locale based label
-   Set the `start` attribute to start at a particular place in a video
-   You can set `autoload` to use Intersection Observer to load the iframe when scrolled into view.
-   Loads placeholder image as WebP with a Jpeg fallback
-   Allows custom placeholder images
-   Allows unlisted vimeo videos

flexibility.

## Misc.

I also wrote a script to track videos views with Google Tag Manager. Since it's in the ShadowDOM, it gets a bit tricky, so [here's a link to that repo](https://github.com/choctaw-nation/gtm-lite-vimeo).
